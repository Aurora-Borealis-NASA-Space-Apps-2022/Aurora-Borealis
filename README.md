# Aurora-Borealis
Official Submission of Team "Aurora Borealis" for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022 participating in the challenge "SAVE THE EARTH FROM ANOTHER CARRINGTON EVENT!"

### Introduction
One of the most powerful solar events of the century was the Carrington Event in 1859. Powerful coronal mass ejections struck Earth directly throughout this event. Globally, including close to the equator, observers of the ensuing impacts and glimmering auroras in the night sky were noticed. Long lengths of the common telegraph transmission lines that were affected by this space weather phenomenon developed geomagnetically induced currents that produced enough current for the lines to function without batteries. In other cases, the induced currents even set some telegraph stations on fire. Fortunately, the Carrington Event had a minimal impact on both world safety and the economy because high voltage (HV) electrical power transmission lines weren't in use at the time.

## Problem Statement/Solution
*What problem does it solve? 
The issue of delayed transmission in solar flare changes.

**What do people gain?**
Quick alert on any solar flare changes.

!Where is the opportunity? 
By speculation, the Carrington event is set to occur in the near future. This is a precautionary step to avoid widespread impact if eventually it happens.


## Idea Description
How does it work?
- Method - Dataset was gathered every six months for 1 year, specifically 2021.
- Parameters - Magnetic field magnitude (BW[nT]) using "Wind Mission Magnetic Field Dataset".
- Model implementation - By using the parameters, an algorithm is created which predicts the intensity of electric flow. The algorithm uses a classifier that trains the dataset and generates a current voltage spectra.
- Language - Python v3.10.


How did using data from one or more of the 10 space partner agencies make your solution possible? 


## Into The Future
What will your idea change? 
People can prepare in advance or even stay away from instruments that can trigger a reaction when the flare hits the Earth. Also, scientists can provide an anti-flare shield such that during the event, no one will be hurt even if close to conductors.

What can your solution do for people, the world, and beyond? 
Save the world from unavoidable solar disasters.

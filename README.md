# Aurora-Borealis
Official Submission of Team "Aurora Borealis" for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022 participating in the challenge "SAVE THE EARTH FROM ANOTHER CARRINGTON EVENT!"


*METHOD*

Dataset was gathered every six months for 1 year specifically 2021.

*PARAMETERS*

Magnetic field magnitude (BW[nT]) using "Wind Mission Magnetic Field Dataset"

*MODEL IMPLEMENTATION*

By using the parameters, we create an algorithm which predicts the intensity of electric flow. the algorithm uses a classifier which trains the datqaset and generate a current voltage spectra. 

*LANGUAGE*

- Python v3.10

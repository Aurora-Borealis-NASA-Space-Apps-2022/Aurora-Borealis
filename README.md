# Aurora-Borealis
Official Submission of Team "Aurora Borealis" for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022 participating in the challenge "SAVE THE EARTH FROM ANOTHER CARRINGTON EVENT!"


Problem Statement/Solution
What problem does it solve? 
The issue of delayed transmission in solar flare changes.

What do people gain? 
Quick alert on any solar flare changes.

Where is the opportunity? 
By speculation, the Carrington event is set to occur in the near future. This is a precautionary step to avoid widespread impact if eventually it happens.


Idea Description
How does it work?
Method - Dataset was gathered every six months for 1 year, specifically 2021.
Parameters - Magnetic field magnitude (BW[nT]) using "Wind Mission Magnetic Field Dataset".
Model implementation - By using the parameters, an algorithm is created which predicts the intensity of electric flow. The algorithm uses a classifier that trains the dataset and generates a current voltage spectra.
Language - Python v3.10.


How did using data from one or more of the 10 space partner agencies make your solution possible? 


Into The Future
What will your idea change? 
People can prepare in advance or even stay away from instruments that can trigger a reaction when the flare hits the Earth. Also, scientists can provide an anti-flare shield such that during the event, no one will be hurt even if close to conductors.

What can your solution do for people, the world, and beyond? 
Save the world from unavoidable solar disasters.
